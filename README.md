🍄 Mushroom Classification using Logistic Regression
This project explores the classification of mushrooms as edible or poisonous using a logistic regression model. The dataset used is a well-known Mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The notebook demonstrates the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
